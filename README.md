# Calculating Statewide Election Results by Congressional District 

### About
This script calculates by congressional district the results of every federal and statewide election in Massachusetts between 2016 and 2022.

These calculations were then used in an [article](https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/massachusetts-redistricting-a-common-story-in-the-commonwealth) analyzing the electoral competitiveness of the state's congressional map. 

More broadly, this workflow is the core of Inside Elections's data projects: the process demonstrated here is repeated for all 50 states (and all 435 congressional districts).
